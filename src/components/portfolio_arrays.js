  'Faith Specialty Plates is a non-profit organization that helps to raise funds for the different organizations that put God first in their mission to help, connect, and bring people together. None of the plates are meant to favor one religious’ group over another; instead, it’s meant to bring together all who have Faith in God. Faith Specialty Plates mission is to  “help people nationwide where the need is greatest, by connecting the public with humanitarian organizations that work with the poor and the oppressed; to promote human transformation and bear witness to the good news of God.” ',
  'Parks2Go is an app that provides information on State Parks around the country. The apps mission is to facilitate park information to make trips as seamless as possible. Adventurers will love the app as individual state parks can be narrowed down by outdoor activities. Users can choose from a variety of activities from kayaking to site seeing. These family friendly trails are the most beautiful of the country and are worth exploring.  The home page will provide users with an interactive USA map. Each state will pull information on the different state parks and will have the opportunity to filter by outdoor activities. Once a park is chosen the app will display Park ideas, Description, Images, Activities, Topics, and Directions. The user will also have the option to choose another park from a horizontal gallery that is displayed at the bottom of the page. The footer will include a link to the About Us page, links to the state parks page of each state and connect with social media icons. Parks2Go acquires park information from different API pulls from https://nps.gov/. This information will fit into the different areas of the park text that is displayed for Park details, Description, Images, Activities, Topics, and Directions. For this application, I will develop 4 pages; Home, State Parks, Park, and About Us. I will be using React to create an interactive UI design. I will be dividing the application into different components for content, styling, functionality, and validation. Parks2Go will be accessible for multiple device sizes. It will be designed with the mobile first approach and then work its way up in size. Once the website is running the site will be tested in multiple browsers, to provide the user with a seamless user experience.',

  'PayItForward is a resource site for faithful ministries to use, as another form of steward outreach. The app is meant to be used by ministry members; in order, to provide a safe environment for both the recipient and the donor. The steward providing the service must go through a background check with fingerprints identification, prior to volunteering; organized by the church who is supplying the service. The site is meant as a form of communication, for services that are in need of care. Recipients can make an appointment for a "faithful steward" via the app or computer. They are then matched with a volunteer, who can run errands, drive to the doctor, watch movies, chat, build, fix, do handywork, garden, paint, mechanics, etc.  ( a small fee may be included for their services). The volunteers do not provide any personal care, like bathing or grooming. They are also not a pick-up or drop-off service, like Uber or Lyft. PayItForward is meant for anyone who needs to get a project or task completed, with the help of a volunteer or at a fraction of the cost. This app will be used by active church members, whose faith are believers of God; whom are part of an active congregation community. Both men or woman within the ages of 30 - 65+, who are either single parents, divorcees, elderly couple, or widowers. They live in a suburban area; whose education is of all levels. Participants earnings are between 30k - 70K. They are either employed full-time or retired. They come from any cultural background and are usually weekend warriors, do it yourselfers, people who cant afford caregivers or contractors, elderly men who cannot undertake big projects, or individuals who need some company. There are some volunteer software’s that provide church ministries a scheduler type system that can keep track of events and volunteers. There are also volunteer applications that offer seniors the opportunity to connect with student volunteers in their area, at a reasonable price/ hour. However, there is none that I found that will connect members with members within the same religious institution. I consider this be a major difference. The app will help further spread the opportunity to fellowship, within the community of servers; connecting the right volunteer to the right service. By working within a same community of faithful’s; not only does stewardship become more convenient for beginner servers whom may not know how to start servicing, but in large church communities where not everyone may know each other, the app can help bring people together.',

  'Faith Specialty Plates (FSP) is a responsive website developed with Bootstrap frameworks. The app currently adapts to desktop, tablets, and mobile platforms. FSP has a simple page layout of a column, except for the 3-module section created with 3 columns. The homepage includes a header, navbar, main article,  3-moduler sections, featured plates, a secondary article, testimonials laid out for a mobile-first flexbox grid  system, and footer. The navbar is fully responsive and programmed to expand on lg devices. Each page link is styled with the nav-link class and the active pages includes the active state to indicate current page selection. The main article contains a read more button, that when clicked, the user will be taken to fsp.com/about that will provide the user with the company’s mission statement and profile; this page is also reached by clicking on the About link from the navigation menu. By scrolling downward, using the scrolling device on the right, the user will experience a single page that is seamless in content. The page is laid out in a 2-column design that zigzags each article alternating its images and description; making it easier to read and scan more efficiently. The 3-moduler sections, beneath read more, is meant to capture the user’s attention by providing a small blurb on the company, on ordering, and on special offers. Each of these sections link to individual pages; fsp.com/ordernow and fsp.com 25 % off. Featured plates is a picture gallery of the available plates. The gallery is displayed with a 12-column system. Distributed evenly in a row. Each image links to a specific section of the fsp.com/about where each plate section is bookmarked. The user also has the opportunity to click on the Featured link from the navigational header.  This page is also laid out in a grid layout system. Each plate is custom made using photoshop and optimized to reduce loading time. Each plate contains a call-to-action order now button that links to fsp.com/ordernow, where the user will have the option of getting a plate with or without annual registration. When the user selects an option and clicks to Buy Now, the user will be provided with a modal window that displays the cart order. At this point the user has the option of clearing the cart and exiting or checking out by adding quantity of plates. The shopping cart will calculate the total according to the quantity amount. Once the workflow has completed its cycle, the user is given a Thank you notice with a brief blurb of what is expected next. The following article includes the Order Now content, displayed in a column layout. This article contains a call to action to order now. By clicking on the button, the user will be taken to the features page where the user can then select a specialty plate. The Testimonials column is a horizontal gallery that displays all the testimonials in a row layout. The last section of every page is the Footer. This section provides the user with the copyright date and company information. The Contact page can be accessed by clicking on the Contact link from the navigational header. This page offers the user the opportunity to submit an email message, by submitting a form from fsp.com/contactus. In addition to bootstraps CSS, I also added a main.css to modify default rules and to implement custom styles. In addition to bootstraps popper and jQuery implementations, I also added a main.js file that includes a singleton class. This class is in charge of the applications arithmetic from the Buy Now call to action. The website has been tested on Safari and Chrome, to provide the user with a seamless user experience.',
